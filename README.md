Orbital Mechanics project

Interplanetary Transfer and Planetary Exploration Mission:

Interplanetary Transfer: Performed a preliminary analysis of an interplanetary transfer between Saturn and a NEO(88), performing a flyby. Implementation of brute force algorithms to optimize the required ΔV. Performed a long term orbit propagation for an Earth’s observation MEO satellite. Compared the results with an existing object. 

Planetary explorer mission: The main focus is on Earth observation by a spacecraft with a given orbit, and the infuence of orbit perturbations. The perturbations co nsidered are 2 and solar radiation pressure (SRP). Characterization of the groundtracks of the spacecraft is used to further analyze the effects of theseperturbations. The infuence of perturbations is analyzed by propagation through two different methods, Cartesian and Gaussian. Lastly a comparison is made between the propagations of the given orbit, and the ephemeris of the orbit of COSMOS-2546 with similar orbit.
